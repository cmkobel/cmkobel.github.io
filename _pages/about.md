I'm a bioinformatician with the perspective that microbiomes are largely undervalued, and that we should better understand the minute interactions within them. I have a big data inspired approach, enjoy tinkering with hardware, and like to build parallelizable bioinformatics pipelines to gain insights into large multi-omic microbiome datasets.

Currently open to work.
